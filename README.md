🗳️ Quick Poll

Quick Poll is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to create, vote on, and view poll results — all directly in the browser. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides an elegant interface for quick feedback collection or fun opinion polls.

💡 Description

Quick Poll lets users create a poll question with multiple answer options. After submitting, users can immediately vote and see the results displayed as percentages.
All data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage, so no backend setup is required.

This makes it ideal for:

Classroom projects and software engineering labs

Small surveys or demos

Lightweight prototypes without a backend
